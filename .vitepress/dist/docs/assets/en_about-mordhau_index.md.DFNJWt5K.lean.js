Developed by Triternion, Mordhau offers players the chance to engage in intense melee battles, customize their characters, and explore a variety of game modes, including large-scale battles, duels, and cooperative missions.</p><p>Since its release in 2019, the game has built a dedicated community of players and modders who are passionate about enhancing the experience through custom servers, mods, and gameplay improvements.</p><h2 id="the-lack-of-documentation" tabindex="-1">The Lack of Documentation <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-lack-of-documentation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The Lack of Documentation&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Despite the game&#39;s success and its active player base, Mordhau suffers from a significant lack of organized and accessible documentation. Key areas such as:</p><ul><li>Setting up and managing dedicated servers.</li><li>Using RCON commands for server administration.</li><li>Understanding and implementing the Mordhau SDK.</li><li>Troubleshooting common errors and issues.</li></ul><p>...are either poorly documented, scattered across forums, or nonexistent. This lack of clear and structured information has made it challenging for community developers and server owners to contribute effectively to the game.</p><p>The absence of official documentation creates a steep learning curve, discouraging new contributors and causing confusion even for experienced modders. This gap has hindered the potential growth and creativity within the community.</p><h2 id="a-solution-for-the-community" tabindex="-1">A Solution for the Community <a class="header-anchor" href="#a-solution-for-the-community" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;A Solution for the Community&quot;">​</a></h2><p>To address this pressing issue, we have created this site to serve as a centralized hub for Mordhau documentation. Our mission is to:</p><ul><li><strong>Organize and centralize information:</strong> <br> No more scattered guides across Discord servers or forums.</li><li><strong>Make documentation accessible and readable:</strong> <br> Designed for both beginners and experienced developers.</li><li><strong>Empower the community:</strong> <br> By providing clear, detailed, and official-like resources, we aim to help server owners, modders, and players contribute more effectively to the game.</li></ul><p>This site is a step forward in bridging the gap between the community&#39;s needs and the resources available. By collaborating as a community, we can ensure Mordhau continues to thrive and evolve with proper support and tools.</p><h2 id="join-us-in-building-the-future" tabindex="-1">Join Us in Building the Future <a class="header-anchor" href="#join-us-in-building-the-future" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Join Us in Building the Future&quot;">​</a></h2><p>We invite everyone in the Mordhau community to contribute to this effort. Together, we can create a comprehensive, organized, and official-like documentation resource that will benefit players, modders, and developers alike.</p><p>Your participation and feedback are crucial to making this vision a reality.
