# What is Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language used to format text in a simple and efficient way. It was created in 2004 by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz, with the goal of making plain text documents visually appealing and easily convertible to structured formats like HTML. Markdown is widely used in documentation, blogging, emails, and code repositories like GitHub.

This markup language has no connection to the game Mordhau, its development, or the creation of mods for it. It is simply a field of knowledge that exists independently and has multiple uses across various domains. We are explaining it here solely because we use it to contribute to the documentation of the game Mordhau, through which you are reading this page.

**Information for those who are unfamiliar with programming or websites:**

HTML is also a markup language and is the foundational structure for all websites. On this page, you are not required to learn or understand it if your intention is only to contribute to Mordhau documentation. You simply need to learn Markdown, which ultimately gets converted into HTML code.

We do not aim to explain programming complexities or immerse you in a world full of technical details. Our sole objective is to direct your focus toward contributing to Mordhau documentation only! Whether you are a beginner in programming languages or have no knowledge of them at all, we are striving to simplify things as much as possible to make your path to contribution easier
